# VBA of Wallstreet

## Overview of Project 

We have been asked by our friend Steve to perform an analysis on the market trends of green companies in order to help his parents with their investments. 

To perform this analysis, we created macros in VBA that looked at the Total Daily Volume and the Rate of Return for green company stocks over the course of certain years. Initially, we looked specifically at the DQ stock, since that was what Steve's parents had invested in. However, in order to ensure we had a more complete picture of the market in green companies and to assist in diversifying Steve's parents' investments, we expanded our analysis over stocks in all green companies.

Finally, once we set up a macro that was both useful for Steve's work and could be easily understood and used by him - for example, by formatting the results and creating simple buttons that can run the analysis on a given year - we refactored our code to reduce runtime and strain on the system, ensuring more efficient results.
